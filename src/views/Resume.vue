    <h1>Resume</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
      I'm <strong>Jonas Bruylant</strong>, a proud DAE graduate since 2024 and a very enthousiastic Game developer.
      <br/> I have gained experience in a lot of the many different sides of game development, but I personally enjoy 
      gameplay programming the most. <br/>
      Inventing, discussing and implementing mechanics and interactions in the game to make
      it feel come alive. 
      <br/>It has gotten to the point where my mind tries to think of how other games migh have done theirs while playing.
      <br/> I also feel a keen interest in AI related programming, defining behaviours such as pathfinding and other useful algorithms.
      I am familiar with AI programming, and am still honing my skills and gaining experience, but my curiousity and interest stands strong.  
      
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I am currently looking for a job as a Gameplay programmer, preferably something related to game interactions that will satisfy the players.
      <br/> Feel free to
