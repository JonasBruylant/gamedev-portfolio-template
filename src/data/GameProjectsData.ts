    <strong>Overseer</strong> is a project I've worked on during my internship and one that I am so proud of. It's been an amazing experience to
    work with the team and learn so many new things and perspectives. After the internship, I was given the opportunity to work on the game
    a week before the QA testing would happen.
    <br/> I've worked on gameplay aspects and mechanics of the game, making sure the player has enough options to defend themselves with spells and traps.
     I've also been involved with the jailing system where units are not usable to the player unless they're freed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The game is about you taking the role of a dark overlord, gathering warriors and minions to fight for you as you defend yourself
     against the humans trying to conquer your dungeon!

        <strong>Sticky Situation</strong> is the result of a course held at DAE, Game Projects is a 4 month long game jam hosted by the school
        to encourage people to make a great game while also learning soft skills and the essence of good communication, planning and team work.
        <br/> 
        <br/>
        The game is made in Unreal Engine 4 and available to download and play on itch.io.
        I was in charge of making the gameplay loop and interactions of the game, to give a quick summary, this refers to: <br/>
        <ul>
        <li>Spawning of the ingredients</li>
        <li>Customer order generation</li>
        <li>Cooking the ingredients</li>
        <li>Combining ingredients to form a dish</li>
        <li>Having the customer react on the quality of your dish</li>
        <li>Customer mood change over time</li>

        The goal of the game is to climb to the top of the tree as quickly as possible, all while dodging and navigating falling objects.

    I've been responible for a number of things in this project, my most proudest one being the ripple effect you see when you activate your time slowing ability
        as this was the first time I was interacting with the Unity Shader editor.
        A quick summary of the things I've implemented:
        <ul>
        <li>Ripple shader effect</li>
        <li>The falling objects hindering/assisting the player.</li>
        <li>The timer looking similar to the art style used for the HUD</li>

            One of the courses I had been taught, showed us different ways of behaviour and AI patterns.
            <br /> This project is the result of my interest in wanting to understand it a bit deeper, by making an already existing
            application, in this case the game 2048, be played by an AI neural network.
            <br /><br />
            At first I had the network learn how to predict the outcome of an XOR notation and test if after multiple generations
            it was able to accurately predict the outcome.
            <br /> After establishing that it works, I hooked it up to the 2048 application.
